# Requirements Specification: Sentinel AI
## Autonomous Purple Teaming Platform

**Project Name:** Sentinel AI  
**Tagline:** "Attack to Defend. Autonomously."  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** March 16, 2026

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for Sentinel AI, an autonomous purple teaming platform with dual-model AI agents, a 12-agent orchestration system, lifecycle hooks, persistent campaign memory, and a full web platform.

### 1.2 Scope
Sentinel AI addresses the reactive nature of traditional cybersecurity by implementing:
- Offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) AI agents with an attack-defense feedback loop
- 12 specialized security agents (5 offensive, 5 defensive, 2 core infrastructure)
- A full-stack web platform with admin panel, client dashboard, blog, SEO, and notification system
- Lifecycle hooks and persistent campaign memory for cross-session learning

### 1.3 Problem Statement
Traditional cybersecurity is reactive, manual, and generates high false positives. Standard AWS native tools (like GuardDuty) are passive observers that alert but do not validate or auto-remediate complex vulnerabilities. Existing security platforms lack persistent memory across engagements.

### 1.4 Solution
An Autonomous Purple Teaming Platform with:
1. **Dual AI agents** — Red Team exploits vulnerabilities; Blue Team auto-remediates
2. **Attack-Defense Feedback Loop** — Red probes Blue's past patches; Blue responds to Red's latest findings
3. **12-Agent Orchestrator** — Specialized agents for recon, scanning, vulnerability detection, compliance, incident response, etc.
4. **Campaign Memory** — Persistent DynamoDB-backed memory enabling cross-session learning with 90-day TTL
5. **Lifecycle Hooks** — Automatic context loading and result persistence across all agent executions

## 2. Functional Requirements (EARS Notation)

### 2.1 Purple Teaming Loop

#### FR-001: Campaign Initiation (Event-Driven)
**WHEN** an administrator initiates a campaign via `POST /campaigns/start`, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** deploy the Red Agent with session identity (`session_id`, `actor_id`), load prior target history from campaign memory, and initialize the attack-defense feedback loop.

#### FR-002: Attack Vector Planning (Ubiquitous)
**THE SYSTEM SHALL** utilize Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) or Ollama (local fallback) to analyze the target and formulate attack payloads including SQL injection, XSS, privilege escalation, and API abuse vectors, enriched with memory context from prior campaigns.

#### FR-003: Offensive Execution (Event-Driven)
**WHEN** the Red Agent formulates an attack payload, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** execute the attack using LangChain `@tool` function calling against the target infrastructure while logging all actions to DynamoDB with proper session/actor IDs.

#### FR-004: Attack-Defense Feedback Loop (Event-Driven)
**WHEN** the Red Agent completes its execution, **THE SYSTEM SHALL**:
1. Persist Red Agent findings to campaign memory via `SecurityHookProvider`
2. Load Red Agent findings + Blue Team's prior defenses as context for Blue Agent via `AttackDefenseFeedbackHook`
3. Execute the Blue Agent with enriched context
4. Persist Blue Agent findings to campaign memory
5. Return combined campaign results

#### FR-005: RAG Knowledge Query (Event-Driven)
**WHEN** any agent requires contextual knowledge, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** query ChromaDB or Bedrock Knowledge Bases to retrieve relevant attack patterns, CVE data, and mitigation strategies.

2. **Scanner Agent** — async port scanning (50-concurrent via semaphore), Nmap or socket fallback
3. **Vulnerability Agent** — NVD API queries with rate limiting (Semaphore(5)), exponential backoff on 403, API key support
4. **Credential Testing Agent** — simulation mode credential checks, clearly labeled as `mode: simulation`
5. **Report Generator Agent** — aggregated reports in JSON, HTML (XSS-safe via `html.escape()`), Markdown

#### FR-011: Defensive Agent Execution (Event-Driven)
**WHEN** threats are detected, **THE SYSTEM SHALL** execute defensive agents:
1. **Threat Detection Agent** — log analysis, anomaly detection, IOC matching, pattern recognition
2. **Hardening Agent** — CIS/NIST/PCI-DSS compliance checking, remediation script generation
