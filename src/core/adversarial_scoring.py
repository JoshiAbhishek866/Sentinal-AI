Adversarial Self-Improvement Scoring for Sentinel AI

Tracks Red vs Blue performance with ELO-like ratings.
After Blue patches a vulnerability, auto-queues Red to re-probe the patch.
Measures whether the system is actually getting better over time.

Fail-graceful: stores in MongoDB, falls back to in-memory if DB unavailable.
